Tiny lab for design work and occasional electronics assembly and diagnostics. Also compacts minimal living space in the same area. Specifically designed to both maximize capability and minimize the physical space needs of hardware and software developers, reducing vulnerability to literal rent seeking behavior.

For contrast, the 'ElectronicsWorkstation' is for arranging the much more diverse supplies and tools needed for the more difficult purposes of both legacy equipment maintenance and pressing slightly defective prototypes into production use.

AGPLv3 license by default. Usual policy of strictly limited no exceptions requirements for any consideration of relicensing applies.

# Directory Specification

Consider keeping a copy of this specification alongside relevant projects for reference.

Please regard as a loose specification intended to offer unallocated regions for expansion and subordinate to any improvements that may be found in actual implementations.


Projects which may be assembled into larger projects, if sufficiently well-developed, should include their own appropriate directories, rather than referencing files shared within larger projects. That is to say, a sort of 'static linking' approach is strongly recommended.



Numbered directories with '[z]-' in their prefix and a '/' may substitute the '/' for either a '-' or separate directories.

Numbered directories of top-directories may be placed alongside top-directories if desired. Numbering scheme is intended to minimize conflicts.

Templates should populate only the most usual directories. Not all directories need be populated for a project.
